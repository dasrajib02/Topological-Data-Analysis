# Topological-Data-Analysis
This project applied the tools of Computational Homology to analyze comple structures. It analyses the amorphous materials and extract inherent structures and properties from it.

Observations: 

• Observed the emergence of topological features in Persistent diagrams (PD1 and PD2) of idealized structures
(toy models) using computational tools and extracted key insights from complex data structures and their
inherent properties.
• Simulated the persistent diagram to understand the inherent structures and properties of Amorphous Materials(
Silica ) for Medium-Range Order(MRO).
• Performed Inverse Analysis and simulated the inverse problem in a 3D configuration.
